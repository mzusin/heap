# Heap (Binary Heap, Priority Queue)

### Space and Time Complexity

- Construct a Heap
  - Time complexity: O(N)
  - Space complexity: O(N)

- Insert an element
    - Time complexity: O(log N)
    - Space complexity: O(1)

- Get the top element
    - Time complexity: O(1)
    - Space complexity: O(1)

- Delete the top element
    - Time complexity: O(log N)
    - Space complexity: O(1)

- Get the size of a Heap
    - Time complexity: O(1)
    - Space complexity: O(1
